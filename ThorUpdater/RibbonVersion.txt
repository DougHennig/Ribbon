# Ribbon

This project provides a ribbon control similar to that of Microsoft Office 365 to VFP forms.

## Release History

### 2025-03-29

* Fixed issue 25: the form the ribbon is on wouldn't close after activating a dropdown menu.

### 2023-12-23

* Fixed an issue with button widths introduced on 2023-07-08: if WordWrap is .T., buttons were sized too narrow.

* Fixed issue 18: under some conditions, more than one menu is displayed.

* Fixed issue 24: if an application has a manifest file that specifies DPI awareness, text width calculations were too wide.

### 2023-07-29

* Fixed issue 17: the menu for the RibbonDisplay button now appears correctly when the ribbon is in _SCREEN.

* You can now use BINDEVENT to bind to a button's OnClick event instead of setting the Command property of the button.

* You no longer get a "Not implemented" message when there's no command for a button.

### 2023-07-23

* Fixed issue 14: made GetThemeColor public so it can be used in other places.

* Fixed issue 15: SFRibbonMenuForm now has ShowInTaskbar set to .F. so the dropdown menu for a button doesn't appear in the Windows taskbar.

* Fixed issue 16: the dropdown menu for a button is now positioned correctly when the ribbon is in _SCREEN.

* Fixed issue 19: the menu for the RibbonDisplay button (appears when AllowShowTabsOnly is .T.) is now placed in the correct location when the ribbon is _SCREEN. However, the menu doesn't actually appear due to a timer issue (see issue 17); that's a bug to be fixed.

* A new sample program, RibbonInScreen.prg, displays a ribbon in _SCREEN.

### 2023-07-08

* Fixed issue 12: button not centered when section label is wider than button

* Fixed issue 13: button too wide when caption is empty

* Implemented [VFPX Deployment](https://github.com/VFPX/VFPXDeployment) so it works with Thor Check for Updates.

### 2022-04-16

* Added support for more than three consecutive horizontal buttons.

### 2022-04-06

* Added a Ribbon Display button to the right side of the ribbon with choices of Show Tabs Only and Always Show Ribbon and added support for hiding the ribbon. This requires adding two new images to your project: SFRibbonCheck.png and SFRibbonDownLarge.png.

* You can specify a dynamic image for a menu bar, one that's determined when the menu is displayed, by specifying an expression surrounded with curly braces for the third parameter in the AddBar call.

### 2021-07-23

* Added DisabledImage property to SFRibbonToolbarButton.

### 2021-02-11

* Changing the Visible property of a button now adjusts the toolbar so buttons and sections are always beside each other with no space in between.

### 2021-01-28

* Added a WordWrap property to SFRibbonToolbarButton; setting it to .T. forces the caption to span multiple lines if necessary.

* The width of the section's caption is now taken into account when determining the section's width.

* Added a Clear method to SFRibbonMenu so you can remove all the items from an object's menu.

* Fixed a bug: ensures the active control in a form has a Visible property before checking it (Visible may have been made protected in a subclass).

### 2021-01-06

* Added EnabledExpression to SFRibbonToolbarButton so you can define when a button is enabled without subclassing and putting code into Refresh.

* Made dropdown menus close if the user clicks the button the menu belongs to again, clicks outside the menu, or moves the mouse outside the form.

* Made changing the width of the ribbon programmatically set the width of the border and shadow lines properly.

* Made SFRibbonToolbarButton.Click work with Command containing "Thisform", such as "Thisform.SomeMethod()".

### 2020-12-29

* Made dropdown menus release the public variable loThisform when they're closed and work when the ribbon is in a top-level form.

* Changed Sample.scx to a top-level form.

### 2020-12-28

* Initial release.
